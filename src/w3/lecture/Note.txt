1. KISS (Keep It Simple and Short)
    - conditional statement, loop -> simple
    - method => has single task, (modularization)
    - Class => field, method in needs

Agile Dev (a.k.a spiral)
    - Spec -> Class design -> implementation -> execution

2. DRY (Don't repeat yourself)
    - minimize duplication

3. SRP (Single Responsibility Principle)
    - one class, one task
    - readability + maintenance

4. OCP (Open Close Principle)
    - open expansion, closed modification
